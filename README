Twilio FizzBzz is a Flask application that uses the twilio API  
to play a game of FizBuzz over the phone. The application can  
be reached by dialing (760) 993-3074. It will request a number  
from the user and it will provide the result of FizzBuzz up  
to the input number.

This application is hosted in OpenShift Online and it can be  
recreated by providing git@github.com:ernestoeperez88/twilio_fizzbuzz.git  
when creating a new app in the OpenShift console.
