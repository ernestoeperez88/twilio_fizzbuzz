Twilio FizzBzz is a Flask application that uses the twilio API  
to play a game of FizBuzz over the phone. The application can  
be reached at _twiliofizzbuzz-ernestoeperez.rhcloud.com_.  
The user must enter her/his phone number and a delay time. 
After the delay has passed, the user will be called asked for a number  
and the application will provide the result of FizzBuzz up to the input number.

This application is hosted in OpenShift Online and it can be  
recreated by providing git@github.com:ernestoeperez88/twilio_fizzbuzz.git  
when creating a new app in the OpenShift console.
